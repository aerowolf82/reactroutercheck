[/]  Root Route: "/"
        As a user, when I navigate to "/" (the root) or when I click the Home button, I am directed to "My Profile Page" with navbar at the top of the page with three buttons (Home, About, Profiles) so that I can see my own profile with my news feed showing the News Articles that I care about.
[/]  About Us Route: "/about"
        As a user, when I click the About button in the navbar, I am directed to the "About Us" page with a small blurb about social-networking company so that I can learn a more about their business.
[/]  Profile View: "/profiles"
        As a user, when I click the Profiles buttons in the navigation bar, I am sent to "Profiles" page so I can see a list of my contacts.
[/]  User Profile Route: "/profiles/:id"
        As a user, when I click on a contacts name in the contact list, I should see their profile alongside the contact list so that I can continue to click through different contacts and see their profiles without navigating away from the contact list.
[/]Pictures Route: "/profiles/:id/profile-image/"
        As a user, I can click the profile picture link in one of my contact's profiles so that I can see an enlarged version of their profile picture.
